#Data Analytics & Mining Calculator for Recommender Systems


Cause i decided to spend 1 hour to make this instead of spending 2 mins on a GC (┛◉Д◉)┛彡┻━┻ 

CF.py: 
For collaborative filltering. Works for both item-item, and user-user.
1) Find mean
2) Normalize the input data
3) Return new data
4) Repeat 1-3 for other data 
5) Find Pearson similarity (Use Pearson similarity unless OTHERWISE stated by the question) 


user.py:
For user profile. Similar to CF.py. Literally deleted 2 lines of codes
1) Find mean
2) Normalize the input data
3) Return new data
4) Need to calculate user profile manually.
-> Find mean of each category with the new data from 3)
